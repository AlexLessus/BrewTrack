# ☕ CoffeeJournal - Brew Track

## 📖 About The Project

I recently started diving into the world of specialty coffee and realized I needed a consistent way to track my brews. The easy way is to buy a notebook, but I saw an opportunity to learn something new, I wanted to build a digital tool that offers precision and data persistence.

**CoffeeJournal** is a native Android application designed to help coffee enthusiasts calculate ratios and log their brewing history. The goal is simple: help you find (and replicate) your perfect cup of coffee.

This project is also a personal journey to master **Modern Android Development** (MAD), moving away from legacy XML layouts to a fully declarative UI with Jetpack Compose.

## ✨ Key Features

* **🧮 Smart Ratio Calculator:** Real-time calculation of water vs. coffee grounds (e.g., 1:15, 1:16).
* **📓 Brew Log:** Save your recipes with details like bean origin, grind size, temperature, and brew method (V60, French Press, etc.).
* **📶 Offline-First:** Built with local persistence in mind. Your data stays on your device, no internet required.
* **⭐ Rating System:** Rate your brews to identify which variables produce the best flavor.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

This project is built using the latest industry standards for Android:

* **Language:** [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/) (100%)
* **UI:** [Jetpack Compose](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose) (Material Design 3)
* **Architecture:** MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel)
* **Database:** Room Database (SQLite)
* **Concurrency:** Coroutines & Flow
* **DI:** Hilt (Dependency Injection)

## 🚀 Roadmap

- [x] Initial UI Design with Compose
- [ ] Implement Calculator Logic
- [ ] Set up Room Database for logging
- [ ] Add filters and search for past logs
- [ ] Data Export (JSON/CSV)

## 🤝 Contributing

This is a personal learning project, but suggestions are welcome! Feel free to open an issue if you have ideas on how to improve the code or the coffee recipes.
